# Machine Learning Approaches for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project explores how machine learning can be applied to predict **cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)** using a large dataset of medical, lifestyle, and demographic factors. It combines both **unsupervised** and **supervised** techniques and provides a complete data science pipeline — from cleaning and clustering to predictive modeling and evaluation.
